# Review
# Lists are a fundamental data structure for any program. 
# When faced with a technical interview problem using lists, 
# here are a few strategies to keep in mind:

# Be comfortable with variables which represent indices in the list, or pointers.

# Accessing the first and last values with indices.

# Modding by the list length will ensure a valid index. (num % length_of_list).

# Pointers can sometimes substitute for copying a list.

# Ordered datasets unlock a lot of solutions.

# Sorted data can be searched in O(logN) time using binary search.

# Sorting can be done in O(N*logN) time.

# Find the “naive” solution and push to optimize.

# Interviewers want the optimal solution, but at least talk through the inefficient approach.
