# Breadth-first search -
# a tree traversal algorithm that explores nodes level by level. 
# Using a queue to store frontier nodes supports the behavior of this search.
# The search can be implemented using an iterative approach.
# It is necessary to return a path of nodes from the root node to the goal node.

# Depth-first search - 
# tree traversal algorithm that goes deep into a tree exploring for nodes branch by branch. 
# Using a stack to store frontier nodes supports the behavior of this search.
