Hi Harrison!

My name is Sophia and I am a linguistics-obsessed software engineer.
I found your profile on LinkedIn and I really like your blog.
I just applied to join Duolingo's SE team in a New Grad role and I would love
your advice about the interviewing and hiring process.
I would love to hear back from you!

Also, I see on your blog that you are an avid Hiker and have visited many 
National Parks. I don't see Shenandoah National Park on that list, but it's one of my favorites.
If you ever get the chance to visit, you need to hike Humpback Rocks-- the view is stunning!

All the best,

Sophia Sommers
